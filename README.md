# Klipper Config for my Ender 3 NG

Current working Klipper config for my Ender 3 NG. Working as in I'm still working on it but it also works.

Built off of my [previous Ender 3 Neo config](https://github.com/TonySac/Ender-3-Neo-Config/tree/main) and [current Voron 0.2 config](https://github.com/TonySac/Voron0-Config/tree/main).
